# YT-DLP PYTHON DOWNLOADER

## Overview:

This program takes in multiple youtube links and will run yt-dlp.exe on those files. I only made this so I don't have to find the folder where my yt-dlp is through the command line and remember the syntax.

If you're actually going to use this, you have to define where your yt-dlp.exe file is located. Change this on line 45. Maybe I'll update this in the future if I find inputting links and pressing enter every time becomes too tedious. 

## Dependencies:

### yt-dlp

### ffmpeg and ffprobe

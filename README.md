# YT-DLP PYTHON DOWNLOADER

This program takes in multiple youtube links and will run yt-dlp.exe on those files. I only made this so I don't have to run "yt-dlp.exe -f bestaudio -x --audio-format mp3 [ytlink]" every time

If you're actually going to use this, you have to define where your yt-dlp.exe file is located. Change this on line 37. Maybe I'll update this in the future if I find inputting links and pressing enter every time becomes too tedious.
